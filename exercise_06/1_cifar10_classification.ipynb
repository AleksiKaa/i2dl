    "Each contains a ```forward()``` method, which outputs a number we can use as a measure for our network's performance. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before finishing the recap, we want to take a look at some regularization methods that have been introduced in the lecture. Those can be helpful to improve the robustness of our model. In this chapter, we're talking about weight regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight regularization (a.k.a \"Weight Decay\") has been introduced to you as a method preventing the model from overfitting to the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization term over the weights of the network is added to the loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L^* = \\underbrace{L}_{\\text{Overall loss}} + \\underbrace{\\lambda R(\\theta)}_{\\text{Regularization loss}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ represents **ALL** the weights of the network, $\\theta = \\{W_1, \\dots, W_n\\}$ and $R(\\theta) \\in \\mathbb{R}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the backward step for each weight matrix $W_k \\in  \\theta$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_k}^* = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_k}}_{\\text{Gradient}}  + \\underbrace{\\lambda \\frac{\\partial R(\\theta)}{\\partial W_k}}_{\\text{Reg. loss gradient}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of the regularization term encodes some preferences in manipulating the weights. In the lecture, we compared two weight regularization methods and their respective preference for weight vectors. We made the following observations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 regularization: Enforces sparsity \n",
    "2. L2 regularization: Enforces that weights have similar values\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common weight regularization method is the L2 regularization. The L2 regularization prefers smaller and more diffuse weight vectors. Therefore, the model is encouraged to take all input dimensions into account rather than focusing strongly on a small number of input dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using weight regularization, the loss function is a composition of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first being the data loss, which is calculated using Cross Entropy loss in our model. The second part is called the regularization loss $R(\\theta)$ and is computed in the L2 case as follows:\n",
    "$$R(\\theta) = \\sum_{k} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} w_{k,i,j}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k$ runs over all weight matrices in the network, and $i, j$ correspond to the spatial height and width of each weight matrix $W_k$."
