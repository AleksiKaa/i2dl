    "# Transformers - Attention is All You Need\n",
    "Welcome to the captivating world of Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In recent years, Transformers have emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in NLP, revolutionizing how we comprehend and process language. Unlike older architectures such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and allowing for parallelization of computations. The seminal paper ['Attention Is All You Need'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the Transformer model, showcasing its prowess in various language tasks and laying the foundation for its widespread adoption. This Jupyter notebook is designed to unravel the intricacies of Transformers, highlighting their architectural nuances, contrasting them with traditional models, and demonstrating their applications across diverse NLP domains! (And in case you were wondering - yes, a certain transformer model created this text :D)\n",

We can imagine, for example, that a verb might need to pay more attention to the subject and object of the sentence, or in the case of the word \"bank\", it might need to pay more attention to the word \"river\" or \"money\" to figure out its own intended meaning. And since language is so complex, you can imagine that there are so many different aspects that each token needs to pay attention to! This is where the idea of multi-head attention comes in:\n",

    "Instead of just using the embeddings directly, we can use linear transformations to down-project into more *fine-grained* queries $QW^Q$, keys $KW^K$ and values $VW^V$ from the embeddings.

Each filter can learn different patterns in the image, and each head can learn different aspects to focus more attention to.\n",

This is super easy to do in Transformers due to the causal masks we discussed earlier! In fact, all we have to do is pass the entire correct sentence into the decoder, and let it run exactly one time. The masking will make sure, each predicted word only depends on the previous words - no need to loop!\n",

However, you will have to implement the parts of the Trainer class, particular the forward pass! Note that have implemented a couple of extra functionalities, such as training from a checkpoint and a gradient accumulation. Gradient accumulation is used, to decouple the batch size from the optimizing step. Instead of performing an update after every batch, we can update our network after n batches. That way, we can choose a smaller batch size to save RAM, and still have the same effects as we would have with a larger batch! Be aware, that this doesn't work as nicely with batch normalization!"

We use your matriculation number and send an email with the login details to the mail account associated. When in doubt, login into tum online and check your mails there. You will get an ID which we need in the next step.\n",
