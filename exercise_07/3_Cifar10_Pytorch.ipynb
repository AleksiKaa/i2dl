Note: On the submission server, the normalization as in the notebook 3 on data augmentation will be performed, so please make sure to use the same normalization! For convenience, we added the precomputed normalization values for you. All normalization you are defining here are tailored to your training.\n",

We use your matriculation number and send an email with the login details to the mail account associated. When in doubt, login into tum online and check your mails there. You will get an ID which we need in the next step.\n",

The only thing that's required to pass this optional submission, is your model to reach at least **50% accuracy** on __our__ test dataset. The submission system will show you a number between 0 and 100 which corresponds to your accuracy.\n",
